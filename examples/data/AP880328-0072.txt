A prostitute who says she posed naked for evangelist Jimmy Swaggart will show those poses in the July issue of Penthouse magazine, a spokeswoman for the publication said today. ``From what I understand, the photographs will recreate the precise poses and actions that Jimmy Swaggart paid for during the long affair,'' said Leslie Jay, vice president and director of public relations for the magazine. ``I also understand that the interview will review every episode in the relationship that ruined this most powerful TV preacher in the world,'' she said in a telephone interview from her New York office. Jay said she had not seen the interview or the pictures. Swaggart stepped down from the pulpit Feb. 21 after tearfully confessing to an unspecified sin against his wife, family and church. Church leaders have said he was photographed with a reputed prostitute outside a seedy New Orleans motel. Debra Murphree says she is the woman in those photographs. Jay said she did not know how much Murphree was paid or about the editorial deliberations behind Penthouse's decision to use the photographs and interview. The National Enquirer decided last month not to use an interview with Murphree after she failed a lie detector test. She told New Orleans television station WVUE she failed the test because she had taken drugs the day before. Paul Levy, the Enquirer's senior editor, said Murphree's companion, John Martinez, 28, offered her story to the Enquirer for $100,000. Martinez has said he also tried to peddle the story to People magazine and ABC-TV's Nightline. Murphree, also known as Debra Arleen Hedge, has three children living with her parents in Indiana and an arrest record in Florida, Tennessee and Louisiana, mainly involving prostitution charges.
