NBC won the U.S. television rights to the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, The Associated Press learned today. NBC, which televised the Summer Olympics in Seoul, had been considered a longshot to get the Barcelona rights. CBS was favored because it already owns the TV rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France. The International Olympic Committee and the Barcelona Olympic Organizing Committee scheduled a news conference later today for the official announcement.
