Leonard didn't stand tall when he patrolled his owner's car lot office, but Reggie Roberts says the 7-foot-long boa constrictor was the best guard he ever had. Somebody broke the office window Sunday, and Leonard is gone. ``I'm just 99 percent sure somebody stole my snake,'' Roberts said Wednesday. ``I don't know why they did it.'' Roberts, who owns T.R. Roberts Motors, is offering a $100 reward for the return of his pet reptile. ``I won't ask any questions,'' he said. ``I just want my snake back. I miss the little fellow.'' He hopes Leonard will be found. The ``Beware! Guard Snake on Duty'' sign remains posted on the business' door. Leonard was kept in a temperature-controlled glass showcase during the day so as not to scare customers. But at night the creature, which Roberts describes as ``just a big baby,'' was given the run of the office. Roberts bought the snake, who is about 8 years old, when the previous owner's landlady objected to Leonard as a tenant. He's had the snake nearly a year. ``I've had him long enough to get good and attached to him,'' Roberts said.
