Eddie Murphy and his assistants ran up $5 million in expenses during the making of the movie ``Coming to America,'' which has made no profit despite $350 million in ticket sales, according to studio records. Last month, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Art Buchwald and producer Alain Bernheim won a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures in which they said the studio took the concept for the 1988 movie from an idea by Buchwald. Paramount was ordered to pay Buchwald and Bernheim 19 percent of the movie's net profits. A financial audit is scheduled during a forthcoming phase of the trial to determine how much money Buchwald and Bernheim should receive. The financial documents released to the Los Angeles Times by court order Saturday were sealed during the trial at Paramount's request, but studio officials had testified that the movie was still in the red. The amount of money Paramount absorbed during the making of the movie could become an issue in the accounting phase of the suit. According to the documents, weekly charges to production made on Murphy's behalf included: $4,920 for a limousine and driver kept on call around the clock, $2,200 for a special motor home for Murphy, $1,592 to the motor home's driver, $1,500 for a personal trainer and $650 for a valet. None of those expenses came out of Murphy's $8 million salary, his 15 percent share of the film's gross receipts, his own travel and hotel expenses or his $5,000-a-week living allowance, according to the documents.
