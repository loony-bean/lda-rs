East Germany's former Communist economics czar, who is accused of corruption, has been released from prison because of failing health, officials said Monday. Doctors agreed that Guenter Mittag, 63, was too ill to remain in jail where he was being held in preventive custody, said East German justice officials who asked not to be identified. Mittag was responsible for economic policy in the Communist government that was ousted during last fall's pro-democracy movement. He had been in prison since December and is accused of corruption and sabotaging the country's economy. Other top officials under investigation by the new democratically elected government include former Communist leader Erich Honecker and longtime security chief Erich Mielke. Mittag suffers from acute diabetes, said East German justice officials. He is considered to be the most ill of all the former Communist party leaders under investigation.
