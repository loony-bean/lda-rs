A U.S. military transport helicopter crashed in eastern Panama, injuring 15 American servicemen, a U.S. Southern Command spokesman said Monday. Spokesman William Ormsbee said in a telephone interview that the Black Hawk aircraft crashed at 2:30 p.m. Sunday in the eastern province of Darien. The injured were taken to Gorgas Military Hospital in Panama City. Ormsbee refused to disclose their identities or the extent of their injuries until next of kin were notified. He also gave no details about the crash and did not say if the helicopter was involved at the time in military exercises.
