A smoky fire in a mobile home early Saturday killed a family of five, authorities said. Fire Chief Bill Haggard said the victims probably died of smoke inhalation. The cause of the fire, which was reported at 5 a.m., was under investigation. ``There was lots of smoke,'' Haggard said. ``The front room was on fire. How long it had been burning, we don't know.'' Ralph Williams, the Herculaneum fire marshal, said the family had no electricity or gas in the trailer home. Herculaneum is 20 miles south of St. Louis. Officials declined to identify the victims, but neighbors said those killed were Paul and Maria Adams, both in their 20s; and their children, Brian, 4; April, 3; and Anthony, 9 months. Officials said that the Adamses had used candles to light the trailer, but that had apparently not been the cause of the blaze. Neighbors said the family had not been able to pay their electric bills and had had the electricity shut off. They said they believed Adams worked at an auto repair.
