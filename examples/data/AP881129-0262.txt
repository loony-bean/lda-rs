Wall Street broke free of the doldrums Tuesday, rallying on strength in the dollar and Treasury bonds. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.09 to 2,101.53. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by a margin of about 12-to-7 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 938 issues up, 551 down and 478 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 127.42 million shares, up from 123.48 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 155 million shares. Wall Street began the day where it left off on Monday, drifting aimlessly for several hours, but the market picked up steam in the afternoon. Analysts theorized the market's oversold condition made stocks ripe for gains, and improvements in the dollar and Treasury bond prices were reason enough for investors to start buying. ``I think the negatives are all on the table,'' said Ralph Acampora, a market analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co. ``Everyone who wanted to sell, sold.'' With those negatives _ such as rising interest rates _ discounted by investors, the market had a better tone, Acampora said. Analysts said program buying also added fuel to the rally, but Tuesday's low volume was evidence that traders were still mistrustful. ``No one believes it,'' Acampora said. ``They won't believe it until it has muscle.'' Many investors were on the sidelines, waiting for Friday's unemployment figures from the Labor Department that might give some clue as to whether the Federal Reserve Board will tighten or relax credit. Michael Metz, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co., said the market expected the Fed to raise its discount rate. The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at a moderate 2.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter. That was up from the government's preliminary estimate last month of 2.2 percent growth, but analysts said the report had a muted effect on Wall Street. RJR Nabisco, which rose 1~ to 90~, was the most actively traded issue on the NYSE as investors jockeyed for position in advance of Tuesday's 5 p.m. EST deadline for takeover bids for the food and tobacco giant. Among blue-chip winners, General Motors was up 1| to 83~, Ford Motor picked up 1] to close at 51\, Procter & Gamble jumped 1[ to 81| and Coca Cola rose 1 to 43. IBM closed up { at 119] after arbitrators ordered Fujitsu Ltd. to pay the computer giant hundreds of millions of dollars for the use of information about the software that runs IBM mainframe computers. The market, which had bid IBM stock up 2~ on Monday, expected the company to receive a much larger award. Among the decliners, AT&T; slipped ] to 29 and Control Data fell { to 17{. As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market rose $19.819 billion, or 0.75 percent, in value. The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 1.18 to 152.43. Standard & Poor's industrial index rose 2.54 to 311.96, and S&P;'s 500-stock composite index picked up 2.27 to 270.91.
