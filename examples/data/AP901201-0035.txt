The Marlboro man has corralled his last horse and Salem's ``springtime'' has ended on Hong Kong TV following a cigarette ad ban that began today in this British colony. The ban is part of a growing campaign in Asia against tobacco companies, which have been accused of targeting Asia's women and children. In a related development, Hong Kong's legislature has urged the government to ban children under the age of 15 from smoking in restaurants. ``Smoking parties'' where a group of young people lounge around a table and chain-smoke cigarettes is a popular pastime in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is also readying legislation to ban smoking in ferries, buses, taxis, government buildings, cinemas and theaters. In other Asian countries, Indonesia has banned smoking in most schools and Singapore has moved to limit advertising.
