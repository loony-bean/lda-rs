They cheered when the fat barkeep Jock was shot. They booed when drug-dealing Leo threatened to torch his wife. And they said, ``Goodbye!'' when eye-patched Nadine threatened suicide. More than 100 fans of the broodingly comic ABC series ``Twin Peaks'' gathered Wednesday night in the Salish Lodge _ the real-life counterpart of the show's Great Northern lodge _ to watch the season-ending episode. Much of the series was shot in this small Pacific Northwest logging town about 30 miles east of Seattle. The audience sat glued to the three glowing screens in the basement ballroom of the Salish, gorging as lustily on cherry pie, doughnuts and coffee as any of the ``Twin Peaks'' townies. ``It's great. It's twisted like me and all my friends,'' said Annie Raye, who came dressed as the character Nadine, down to the makeshift patch over her left eye. ``Nadine knows a lot she's not telling,'' Ms. Raye said, referring to the unsolved murder of the character Laura Palmer in the show. ``Nadine has spent time alone with the log.'' The log, for those uninitiated in the hour-long series that will return in the fall, is usually carried by the ``log lady,'' a psychic who talks with it for insight. Locals say ``Twin Peaks,'' with its dueling-chainsaw loggers, satanic cults and macabre death plots, has little to do with the real Snoqualmie. But they're addicted anyway. Garnet Cross, who bakes pies for the cafe immortalized by the show _ the Mar-T in nearby North Bend _ was given a front row seat at Wednesday's gathering. Ms. Cross, who has baked pies for 50 years, said the demand for her authentic cherry pies has exploded since FBI agent Dale Cooper first smacked his lips over the Double R Diner's cherry pie in the ``Twin Peaks'' pilot. She said people include the Mar-T on trips to Washington now, and she's had requests to mail pies out of state. ``This is the best thing that's happened to me,'' she said. Mar-T owner Pat Cokewell said: ``We used to sell about one a week. Now we sell as many as she makes.'' The ballroom gathering was organized by radio station KLSY, which has started calling itself the official ``Twin Peaks'' station. Announcer Tim Hunter said he got hooked after watching the first episode. He said he received more than 200 calls when he asked if listeners wanted the station to recap the show each week. That led to a radio contest, and winners got to come to the season-finale party in real ``Twin Peaks'' territory. At least one local wasn't happy with the show. Louis Delicino looked harried in his Salish Lodge tuxedo shirt and bow tie as he rushed from table to table delivering plates of cherry pie. Pausing with three plates balanced on his left arm and two more in his right, the Snoqualmie native said, ``This is surely madness over a TV show that has no connection to real life.''
