Harrison Ford worked as a carpenter before he struck gold as an actor, and finding a month to do nothing but make furniture is now one of his unfulfilled fantasies. Ford took up carpentry to pay the bills before landing a role in ``Star Wars'' in 1977, he tells US magazine in its Aug. 20 issue. His most recent foray into carpentry was about a year ago when he built a bed for his 3-year-old son, Malcolm. ``He watched me make it. But I'm sure he thinks that everybody's dad makes their bed,'' Ford said. Today, after an Oscar nomination for ``Witness'' and with the ``Indiana Jones'' series on his resume, he earns about $10 million per film. His latest is ``Presumed Innocent,'' in which he plays a big-city prosecutor accused of murdering a colleague-lover. Ford, 48, says carpentry is something he'd like more time for. ``I'd like to actually have a month and actually not do anything else but work on some furniture, work on honing those skills which I haven't practiced for so long,'' he said.
