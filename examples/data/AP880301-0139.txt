A county supervisor who prides himself on doing right by his district and recently offered $1 to any constituent who spotted a pothole, has issued a $5 bounty on flooded intersections. ``Whether I pay off one or two, it'll be the best survey the Flood Control District ever had,'' said Kenneth Hahn, who is running for an unprecedented 10th term. ``It'll keep the Flood Control engineers out of their offices in downtown and down in the streets where they belong,'' he said. The offer, intended to pull the plug on storm-caused flooding, is good from Tuesday through March 10. Hahn paid $3 on his pothole offer _ $2 of it to a Los Angeles Herald Examiner reporter who cruised the byways of the 2nd District in a near-fruitless search for poor pavement. ``I pride myself on taking care of my district,'' Hahn said. ``If you do your homework and take care of the little things in your district, the big things will take care of themselves.''
