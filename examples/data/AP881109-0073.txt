A Republican candidate for Potter County commissioner who died with his name still on the ballot won overwhelming election over both his Democratic opponents, one of whom faces vote fraud charges. Republican Paul Roberts died in September after the deadline for removal of names from the ballot had passed. He received 4,076 votes Tuesday, while Jay Kirkman II got 1,879 votes and write-in candidate Harold Cliver received 521 votes. County Judge Elisha Demerson will decide who must fill the dead man's seat, which had been vacated by a retiring Republican. Asked how he felt about finishing second to a dead man, Kirkman replied, ``I'm not dissatisfied. I think it's a trend down the whole ballot from the national ticket. Everybody voted straight Republican.'' Six days before the election, Kirkman was indicted by a county grand jury on charges of forgery and illegal acceptance and spending of campaign funds. If convicted, Kirkman faces a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $2,000 fine in each of three counts.
