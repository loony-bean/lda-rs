The White House described the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan today as a ``welcome first step,'' and expressed the hope the entire force will be gone by the end of the year. ``We look forward to seeing the withdrawal proceed on schedule and will continue to monitor the progress,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. After a bloody eight-year occupation of their neighbor, the Soviets began withdrawing troops on Sunday. The spokesman said that the U.S. policy of support for the freedom fighters that have battled the Soviets ``remains steadfast.'' The United States has said that it will continue to supply weapons and other materials to the resistance fighters as long as the Soviets continue their support of the Kabul regime. Under the Geneva accord on Afghanistan, half of the estimated 115,000 troops are scheduled to leave by August and the rest by February. Fitzwater said the withdrawal was ``a welcome first step in the Afghan peoples' desire for independence and self determination.'' ``As the Soviets leave, we remain confident that a broadbased government chosen by the Afghan people and not imposed from outside will replace the Kabul regime,'' the spokesman added. Asked if the administration believes Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will pull out all his troops, Fitzwater responded in the affirmative. ``We obviously hope the withdrawl can be complete by the end of the year,'' Fitzwatar said. Asked if that included Soviet advisers as well as troops, he responded, ``A Soviet's a Soviet.''
