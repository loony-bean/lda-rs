Fire swept through a three-story apartment building early Saturday, killing six immigrants, including two children, as they huddled in their kitchen, authorities said. The fire started in a vacant second-floor apartment and spread to the hallway and third floor, said Newark Fire Department spokesman Larry Krieger. ``There was no one in the apartment when it started,'' he said. ``It was being remodeled and someone could have left something on.'' Three men, a woman and two young children died when their third-floor apartment was engulfed by flames, Krieger said. The victims were found in the kitchen, he said. Another man in the apartment, Juan Rodriguez, managed to escape by jumping out a window. Krieger said the seven, natives of the Dominican Republic, had moved in less than a week earlier. Identities of the victims were not immediately released because relatives had not been notified, Krieger said. He said one child was about 3 months old, the other 2 years old. Rodriguez and five residents of another apartment were taken to University Hospital, Krieger said, but hospital officials said their records indicated that only five people were treated. Three of the five, including Rodriguez, were admitted for observation and were listed in fair condition, hospital officials said.
