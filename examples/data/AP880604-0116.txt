Former Virginia Gov. Charles S. Robb, nominated by acclamation for the U.S. Senate, was shouted down during his acceptance speech Saturday by Democratic convention delegates who support Jesse Jackson's presidential candidacy. Robb was briefly surrounded by Jackson supporters as he walked down the center aisle of the convention hall to make his speech, amid shouts of ``Jesse.'' About midway through his speech, 60 Jackson supporters began shouting again. Robb continued speaking for a few minutes until the dissidents made their way toward the platform. By then, they were surrounded by Robb supporters shouting the former governor's name. ``Whoever said Democrats didn't have any life left in them?'' an obviously exasperated but still smiling Robb said. He then quit speaking. Saturday's floor incident came on the heels of a Friday meeting between Robb and Virginia leaders of Jackson's campaign. The session, which lasted more than an hour, was held in an effort to settle complaints that Robb has not supported Jackson for a position in likely nominee Michael Dukakis' White House bid. Robb, asked what the Jackson supporters wanted him to do, said, ``I'm not real certain.'' Convention delegates voted down a floor motion to open debate on allocating the party's 75 national convention delegates, 37 of which went to Jackson, 22 to former candidate Albert Gore Jr. and 16 to Dukakis. The three-way split reflects the outcome of the Super Tuesday primary in Virginia.
