Twenty years after a sniper's bullet felled Martin Luther King Jr., his dream of equality and prosperity for American blacks still shines like a beacon. Despite some remarkable progress, however, for too many it remains only a dream. The first story of three in a series that assesses black progress in economics, politics and social influence looks at a poor West Side Chicago neighborhood where King lived in 1966 to wage war on slums and poverty.
