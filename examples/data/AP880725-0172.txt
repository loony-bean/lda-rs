Police seized 15 tons of hashish in a specially built tunnel between two Mediterranean resort towns and made seven arrests, the civil governor's office said Monday. The office called it the largest drug haul ever in Spain. Among those arrested was Jacques Antoine Cannavaggio, 51, from Corsica, who was said to be the brain of an international drug trafficking organization. He was wanted by the French police. According to police in Barcelona, Cannavaggio had operated in southern Italy and France before moving a few years ago to L'Escala, a village on Spain's northeastern Costa Brava. Police said a French national, a Portuguese and four Spaniards also were arrested. Police found the 15 tons of hashish Sunday in a tunnel between the towns of Lloret de Mar and Tossa de Mar on the Costa Brava. The tunnel was equipped with a special ventilation system and police estimated the tunnel cost $1 million to build. Police said they also seized a yacht and a motorboat allegedly used to transport the hashish to Spain from Morocco. Police also seized six submachine guns.
