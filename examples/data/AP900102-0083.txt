AIDS victim Ryan White spent the New Year's holiday with pop singer Michael Jackson, resting and watching movies at Jackson's California ranch, White's mother said Tuesday. Jeanne White said her son had been at Jackson's ranch in Santa Barbara, Calif., since Thursday and was expected to return to Cicero later Tuesday. ``They've had a really good time,'' Mrs. White said in a telephone interview. She said the trip had taken her son's mind off of his most recent physical ailments. White, who turned 18 last month, has recently suffered staph infections, a low-platelet count, a hernia, a protein deficiency and fluid retention. A hemophiliac, White contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome from a blood transfusion. Four years ago, he was barred from attending Western Middle School near Kokomo by officials who feared the AIDS could be transmitted to other students. A judge ruled that Ryan should be allowed to attend school because the disease can not be transmitted through casual contact. Since then, the Whites have moved to Cicero, where Ryan attends Hamilton Heights High School. White was hospitalized before Christmas to alleviate swelling in his abdomen caused by fluid retention. During the two-day hospital stay he lost four pounds of fluid, his mother said. ``It made him more comfortable.'' Mrs. White said his treatments include drinking a protein supplement five times a day.
