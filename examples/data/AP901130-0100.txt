A court has fined a hunter $180 for killing another hunter he thought was an elk, the Swedish national news agency TT reported Friday. ``I saw something in the woods. I thought it was an elk and Shot,'' the 70-year-old elk hunter told the court. The victim was a Bird hunter. The elk hunter was convicted of causing another person's death. The shooting occurred in a central Sweden forest in September. The court accepted the hunter's testimony that the shooting was accidental. Swedish courts generally impose light sentences in such cases.
