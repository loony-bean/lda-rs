The University of Miami was voted national champion Tuesday in the second narrowest voting since The Associated Press began its postseason college football poll 21 years ago. Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz, whose team finished second, was one of those who had a better choice in mind. ``You can justify why Miami won it. What you can't justify is why we didn't,'' Holtz said a day after the Fighting Irish defeated previously unbeaten and top-ranked Colorado 21-6 in the Orange Bowl. ``We played the toughest schedule, we had the best record ... and we beat the No. 1 team quite decisively,'' Holtz said in an emotional statement likely to renew debate over a playoff system. Miami won its third national championship in the last six years by beating Alabama 33-25 in the Sugar Bowl on Monday night. The Hurricanes and Notre Dame each finished with one loss, but Miami beat the Irish 27-10 on Nov. 25. ``There is no doubt in my mind that we're the best team in the country,'' Miami coach Dennis Erickson said. ``It just happens that it came down to two teams with one loss, and we beat them.'' Miami (11-1) received 39 first-place votes and 1,474 points, with Notre Dame (12-1) getting 19 first-place votes and 1,452 points. The 22-point margin was the second closest since the AP began its postseason poll of sports writers and broadcasters in 1968. The other two first-place votes went to No. 3 Florida State, the only team to beat Miami this season. Colorado fell to No. 4. Miami also was chosen No. 1 in United Press International's coaches' poll, and by USA Today-CNN. Erickson said the close vote will increase calls for a playoff in college football. ``The debate is going to go on until there is one. I really believe down the road there will be a playoff system,'' he said.
