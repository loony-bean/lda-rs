Two residents have put up a billboard asking a million-dollar question _ how much should Ivana Trump get in her divorce from Donald Trump? The sign was put up Tuesday at an intersection in this central Pennsylvania town. It reads: ``Do you think Ivana Trump should get more than $25 million?'' Mrs. Trump's attorneys have rejected a $25 million sum specified in a prenuptial agreement. In arranging for the billboard, residents Lea Isenberg and Jim Smith had a motivation familiar to real-estate developer Trump _ the profit motive. The billboard gives 900-line phone numbers to call to vote yes or no, for a charge of $1. ``When we first started kicking it around at work, we actually discussed creating our own game titled, `Trump _ the Divorce,''' Isenberg said Wednesday. ``But we found out we could actually make some money through the billboard idea. ``In just two days we've been contacted by people from as far away as San Antonio, Cleveland, Memphis and Detroit,'' she said. During that time they received 54 calls, 58 percent in favor of giving Mrs. Trump more money and 42 percent against it, Isenberg said.
