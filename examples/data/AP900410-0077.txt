Gov. George Mickelson told an interviewer he learned of a Nov. 28 incident at the governor's mansion from his son. The governor had kept mum for months about the incident, listed on a Nov. 30 Pierre police log as a rape. In an interview broadcast Monday night on television station KELO, Mickelson was asked how he first learned that something had happened Nov. 28. ``My son told me,'' Mickelson said. ``Before it came through on the police report?'' interviewer Steve Hemmingsen asked. ``Yes,'' the governor replied. However, Mickelson said through his press aide today that he misunderstood Hemmingsen's question when the interview was tapedin principle announced last Friday by Chicago-based UAL. The formalization of the buyout pact sets into motion the process for United's three employee unions to approve wage cuts and other contract concessions designed to save $2 billion over five years as a contribution toward the buyout. Under the agreement reached Friday, UAL's 71,000 employees will buy 100 percent of the company by exchanging for each share of UAL stock $155 in cash, $35 in UAL notes and one share in Covia Corp. valued at $11. Covia is the UAL subsidiary that owns United's 50 percent interest in the Apollo computerized reservations system. The deal, valued at $201 a share, could take up to eight months to complete. The agreement gives the employees four months to secure financing and another four months to complete the deal. UAL's stock was down 25 cents at $160.75 in early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.
