The forecful editorial voice of Panama's La Prensa newspaper will be heard again Sunday for the first time in nearly two years if its exiled publisher can ``patch it together'' in time. ``We are running around like chickens with our heads cut off buying computer parts and so forth and hoping to get our first edition out on the streets by Sunday morning,'' Roberto Eisenmann Jr. said Thursday. Eisenmann, who has worked as a Miami bank executive while in exile, planned to travel to Panama City today in the absence of ousted leader Gen. Manuel Noriega. Pro-Noriega forces repeatedly shut down the presses of Panama's leading independent newspaper, the last time in February 1988. After receiving a dire report on conditions at the newspaper office, Eisenmann said, ``I don't know how we're going to do it with 95 percent destruction, but we're going to do it.'' Staff members returned to the newspaper plant on Christmas Day for the first time since the closure. ``The team came together immediately, and everybody's been working around the clock cannibalizing all the equipment to make one computer out of three,'' he said. ``We're going to patch it together with Band-Aids and be on the streets.'' Eisenmann, whose voice had been a thorn in the side of Noriega, said he had ``absolutely no problem'' with U.S. prosecution of Noriega on drug charges. ``Panama at this point has no capability. The judiciary system is not yet organized,'' he said. ``There isn't even a secure jail in the country at this point.'' The publisher said he expected Noriega to be returned to Panama for prosecution on human-rights abuses after the U.S. trial. Meanwhile, Eisenmann's time was occupied with ordering computer parts and preparing to fly home. ``When you're in exile, you live for the return,'' he said. ``Everybody that I know is packing bags and getting ready to go back.''
