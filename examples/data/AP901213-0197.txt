A company that once beamed pornographic movies via satellite to television viewers pleaded guilty to a second federal charge, prosecutors said. Home Dish Only Satellite Networks Inc. will pay a $150,000 fine and has stipulated that movies it distributed via satellite, such as ``Hard Core Girlfriends'' and ``Ramb-Ohh Sex Platoon,'' were pornographic by community standards, Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Lambert said Wednesday. The movies were beamed to 30,000 subscribers to its American Exxxtasy Channel. Company attorneys appeared Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Aldon Anderson. They entered the plea to a count of distribution of obscene matter via satellite transmission. As part of the plea bargain, company operators Paul L. Klein and Jeffrey Younger have promised to refrain from promoting or distributing sexually explicit films or publications and will cooperate with investigators looking into the pornography industry, Lambert said. The company pleaded guilty to a similar charge Nov. 29 in Buffalo, N.Y. Until investigators pulled the plug on the operation last March, Home Dish was the only nationwide satellite network beaming hard-core pornography to home television viewers, the Justice Department said. The movies were transmitted from the company's Buffalo office to a satellite uplink station operated by U.S. Satellite Inc. in Murray, Utah, which in turn relayed them to a satellite. In Salt Lake, the company pleaded guilty for the Feb. 26 transmission of the movie ``Hard Core Girlfriends,'' Lambert said. The charge in New York stemmed from the transmission a day earlier of a movie entitled ``Hot Shorts.'' U.S. Attorney Dee Benson in Utah said U.S. Satellite was not prosecuted because it cooperated with the investigation. Benson said Klein and Younger were not prosecuted individually because of their willingness to stay out of the business and cooperate with a Department of Justice's investigation into the pornography industry.
