The stock market was broadly lower in early trading today, pressured by ongoing concerns about this week's Treasury's refunding. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 20.27 points to 2,586.04 at 10 a.m. EST, 30 minutes after the opening bell. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of nearly 5 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 835 issues down, 178 up and 378 unchanged. Volume on the Big Board came to 24.08 million shares. Analysts said weakness in the bond market kept stocks under pressure. The market's worries stem from the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction and whether yields will have to be forced higher to attract Japanese investors. The three-day auction, which began on Tuesday, comprises $30 billion in notes and bonds. Tuesday's refunding included $10 billion of three-year notes. Today's refunding will include $10 billion in 10-year notes and the final part on Thursday will comprise $10 billion of 30-year Treasury bonds.
