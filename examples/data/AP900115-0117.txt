Two policemen injured when the brakes failed on an ambulance operated by Mother Teresa's hospital remained hospitalized Monday, doctors said. Two other pedestrians died after they were struck in Saturday's accident. Doctors treating the two constables said on condition of anonymity they were still under medical care but gave no other details. Police initially reported that Mother Teresa was in the ambulance when the accident occurred. But police and the 79-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner's fellow Roman Catholic nuns said Sunday she was not in the vehicle. ``There was confusion because she reached the scene within minutes,'' an officer said on condition of anonymity. The accident occurred on a busy street a few hundred yards from the building where Mother Teresa lives. Several nuns wearing blue and white saris identical to Mother Teresa's attire were in the ambulance, adding to the confusion. The ambulance was carrying medical supplies but no patients when the accident occurred. Police said its brakes failed and it struck two pedestrians who had just stepped off the sidewalk into the street. The ambulance then veered onto the sidewalk and struck the two constables, according to the police reports. Mother Teresa accompanied the injured to a nearby hospital, where two of them late died, the police report said. Mother Teresa, who was born in Yugoslavia, won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work among Calcutta's destitute and dying. The Missionaries of Charity, the Roman Catholic order she founded in the city in 1959, has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries. The frail nun suffered a heart attack in September and resumed work last week. Members of her order said Sunday that Mother Teresa's health was stable but that she was saddened by the deaths.
