Dall Forsythe, son of ``Dynasty'' television star John Forsythe, is getting his own dynasty of sorts _ New York state's budget. Gov. Mario Cuomo on Wednesday named him budget director. Forsythe, whose mother is actress Parker McCormick, succeeds R. Wayne Diesel, who announced his resignation last week to join an investment bank. Forsythe joined the Cuomo administration as deputy budget director in January 1986 and became director of Cuomo's Office of Management and Productivity in September. He had previously worked at Shearson Lehman Brothers as a senior vice president for investment banking and has a doctorate in political science from Columbia University and has taught political science and finance at Columbia. Forsythe, 45, will be paid $92,059. The budget director is the governor's chief fiscal adviser and is largely responsible for handling the executive branch's end of state budget negotiations. The budget director also is largely responsible for formulating the governor's annual budget proposal.
