The complete works of filmmaker Milos Forman, Oscar-winning director of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' and ``Amadeus,'' are being bought for distribution in Czechoslovakia 20 years after he left his native land. A report in Friday's Communist Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo announced the purchase, confirming rumors in Prague that Forman movies such as ``Hair'' finally will be seen in the country where he spent his first 36 years. ``It is great that they will show his films at last, I just don't know why they couldn't do so before,'' actress Vera Kresadlova, Forman's first wife and mother of his twin sons, told The Associated Press by phone. ``I guess they finally realized that if Milos `walks' the streets of Prague again, it doesn't have to cause a riot.'' A Prague film critic who asked to remain anonymous welcomed the news and opined it indicated that ``those friends and colleagues of his (Forman's) who managed to keep the lid on his work for a long time are finally retiring.'' Forman's first films were made in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s, including ``Fireman's Ball,'' which is enjoying another run in Prague right now, according to Rude Pravo. Forman moved to the United States in 1968, when Warsaw Pact tanks ended the ``Prague Spring'' reforms, and started his second career with ``Taking Off'' in 1971. But it was ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' that brought him worldwide fame, winning five Oscars and becoming a symbol of artistic skill for Czechoslovaks who were not able to see the film officially. In 1977, Forman was given American citizenship and went on to make ``Hair'' and ``Ragtime.''Neither was purchased by Czechoslovakia's state-run film distribution firms. With the spread of video in the 1980s, bootleg copies spread on the black market in Czechoslovakia. Forman returned to Czechoslovakia in 1983 to shoot ``Amadeus'' in Prague. The film was shown in 1986 as Czechoslovakia's most other famous exile in the United States, tennis star Martina Navratilova, returned to her native land to play in the Federation Cup tournament. In 1987, Forman went to Moscow's international film festival as signs emerged that the Soviet drive for more openness in the arts was breaking down some previous tabus in Czechoslovakia's state-run arts.
