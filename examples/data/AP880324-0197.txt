A turkey chase left 71-year-old Lucille Andrews stuck in the mud in her car for two days. ``Miss Curiosity'' had a wonderful time. When she was located Wednesday by frantic relatives, the St. Clair County woman said she spent her time spying on wildlife, and wasn't concerned about food and water. ``I was no more scared than I am right now,'' Mrs. Andrews said from her home. ``I knew someone would find me.'' The air and ground search began after she was reported missing Monday afternoon. Mrs. Andrews said she had been out driving, and caught site of a turkey. ``I saw that turkey going out there and I thought, `You fool thing. If you got a nest out there, I'm going to follow you and find you,''' she said. She followed the turkey across a field, but her car got stuck in a swampy ditch. ``At night, I locked the doors and rolled up the windows and went to sleep. During the day, I looked around and thought, `Boy I'd like to have my house up on that hill,''' she said. Mrs. Andrews didn't see the turkey again, but did see three deer and a bear cub. ``The moon was shining so bright that I raised my head up and there was a little old bear. He was just a baby,'' she said. While Mrs. Andrews communed with nature, her eight children, most of her 15 grandchildren and assorted friends and relatives formed a ``family posse'' that combed the woods around her house. ``We were driving everywhere,'' said grandson Mark Andrews, 21. Andrews said his grandmother, who walks with a cane because of arthritis, is called ``Miss Curiosity'' by family members because ``she's always doing something.'' ``I hate housework and all of that stuff, but I do love to drive,'' Mrs. Andrew said. ``If I had to stay in the house I think I would die.''
