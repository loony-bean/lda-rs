Daily News Publisher and President James Hoge has been elected chairman of the 1991 Pulitzer Prize board, Columbia University President Michael I. Sovern announced today. Hoge succeeds Eugene L. Roberts Jr., executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer and president of Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., who remains a Pulitzer board member. Hoge will serve as chairman for one year. In addition, scholar and critic Helen Vendler and Marilyn Yarbrough, dean of the University of Tennessee College of Law, have been elected to the board. Their election fills a vacancy left by Charlotte Saikowski, former Washington bureau chief of the Christian Science Monitor, and another created when the board voted to expand from 17 to 18 members in April. The Pulitzer board is responsible for recommending to Columbia University's trustees whom they should honor with annual awards for excellence in journalism and the arts.
