A forest fire in the southern Black Hills moved into Custer State Park early today. More people fled their homes, and the U.S. Forest Service bolstered its firefighting efforts. Park Superintendent Rollie Noem said the fire jumped Highway 87, the park's main north-south road, at about 3 a.m. A lodge and some private homes in the area were evacuated. Forest Service spokeswoman Mary Sue Waxler said the size of the fire was about 3,000 acres. About 350 people were fighting the fire, Waxler said, with 100 more on the way. No injuries and no structural damage were reported. No buildings were threatened but fire trucks were standing by to protect property. On Wednesday, 14 homes were evacuated in the general path of the fire. The fire stopped advancing about 1{ miles from the homes. The number of people who live in the area was not known. But officials said 25 families went to a temporary shelter at the Custer Armory looking for places to stay. Shelter director Mary Hutt said all found rooms either with family or friends. The fire was reported about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday by a state fire lookout. Officials said it was caused by logging equipment in a timber sale area south of Cicero Peak. Cicero Peak is a 6,100-foot mountain about 10 miles south of Custer and 10 miles west of the western border of Custer State Park.
