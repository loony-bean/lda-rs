The Australian Orchestra says it's honored to host the final performances of Dame Joan Sutherland, but watching the last show will be a costly proposition. Ms. Sutherland, 63, announced in London on Wednesday that the Australian Opera's performance of ``Les Huguenots'' in September will be the swan song of her 40-year career. All eight performances already are sold out. Tickets for the final show on Oct. 2 were snapped up at the beginning of the year and a premium seat cost $390 (U.S.). She was to have brought down the curtain for the last time at London's Covent Garden in December and January with Strauss' opera ``Die Fledermaus,'' but changed her mind due to the heavy demands of singing the part of the vivacious Rosalinde. Her husband, conductor Richard Bonynge, said Wednesday during a break in the Sydney rehearsals for ``The Gipsy Princess'' that ``Die Fledermaus'' was ``too hard on the legs _ a killer for her.'' ``It's a long, demanding role, involving dancing and costume changes,'' he said. ``She is on stage for the entire first act, most of the second and all of the third. ``By contrast, `Les Huguenots' is one of her old party pieces. She's on for one act and a bit in a five-act opera. Joan wanted to go out on top and not tarnish the public's memories of her earlier performances in `Fledermaus.' ''
