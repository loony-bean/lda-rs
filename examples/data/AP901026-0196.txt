A midshipman was expelled from the Naval Academy for having sex on campus with a woman who had accused him of rape. The junior midshipman, who was not identified by the academy, was initially accused of raping the woman, but academy spokesman Noel Milan said investigators never found enough evidence to support the allegation. ``Very early on, it was determined that there was not enough evidence to proceed with the (rape) case,'' Milan said. The student told authorities he met the woman at a downtown bar, brought her back to the academy and had sex with her early May 13, a Navy official said. The midshipman was found guilty of violating a rule that bars midshipmen from having sex on academy grounds and expelled earlier this month, Milan said. Officials are considering whether the midshipman may also have to reimburse the academy for his education. ``That decision is yet to be made,'' Milan said. The expelled student may be required to serve time in the Navy or reimburse the Navy for the cost of his education. The expulsion is the latest of several reports of mistreatment involving the 4,500-student academy. Annapolis police are investigating a report that a midshipman broke into a woman's home Sept. 8 and chased her around her house until she locked herself in a bedroom. A female midshipman resigned last spring after reporting she was handcuffed to a urinal. Other women and minorities later came forward with stories of mistreatment at the academy by male officers and students.
