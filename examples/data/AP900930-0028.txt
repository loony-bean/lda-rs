A rapist says his life was ruined by a judge who called the victim a ``pitiful woman'' as he rejected a prison sentence worked out in a plea bargain. ``He has created a living hell for me,'' said Mark Edward McCulloch, who accepted a 4{-year prison term offered by prosecutors but was placed on probation for two years. ``I was ready to go to jail.'' McCulloch now fears for his safety, saying, ``I can't walk out of the door without fear of losing my life. He put me at risk. Anyone can take a shot at me.'' Gov. Bob Martinez and others called for the resignation of Seminole Circuit Judge Kenneth Leffler after the sentencing, but the judge is returning to the bench Monday under a self-imposed limit restricting his cases to civil suits. McCulloch rented a room from the victim, a 40-year-old Casselberry woman, for two years and accepted full responsibility for the rape April 9. The woman said her tenant became infatuated and obsessed with her. Leffler, who presided over the woman's 1987 divorce trial, said at the sentencing, ``I'm almost of the belief that she is a victimizer of men.''
