A grieving Indian man went from corpse to corpse, searching for five relatives in the dimly lit refrigerated warehouse used as a morgue for victims from the Iran Air jetliner downed by U.S. Navy missile fire. Iranian guides removed the lids from rough wooden coffins and unwrapped the plastic from around several bodies to display the corpses, many of them mutilated by the crash. ``Its a terrible thing that the superpower has done,'' said the weeping Indian to a group of Western journalists. He would give his name only as Farid. While morgue employees were preparing the bodies of at least 38 foreign victims to be returned home, those of most of the Iranian victims were flown to Tehran for a mass funeral Thursday. In Tehran, tens of thousands of people lined up behind the coffins, which were draped with Iranian flags and borne on pallbearers' shoulders to Martyrs' Cemetery. The streets reverberated with cries of ``Revenge, revenge!'' and ``Death to America!'' as the cortege wound through the city. To visit the morgue, reporters flew to Iran from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates to the southern Iranian port of Bandar Abbas. Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down Sunday while flying in the opposite direction. Several guides wore handkerchiefs around their faces to keep out the stench of death in the makeshift morgue. The refrigerators of the Mostaan Cold Storage Depot, which held 100 bodies, could not totally conceal the odor. As reporters talked with the Iranians, Farid looked at the face of each body. He finally discovered those of his sister and brother-in-law. He sobbed as he touched their faces and arms.
