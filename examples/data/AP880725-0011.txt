Comic Phyllis Diller says she's had a habit of dressing as a nun in public for the past decade to avoid being recognized, especially when she's out shopping. ``People tend to leave nuns alone, so I'm able to do my shopping dressed that way. It prevents people from asking me for my autograph,'' Diller said in this week's People magazine. ``I'm able to buy all the crazy things I like to wear because I pretend to be the nun in charge of the drama department at Marymount College, so they think it's for our little play,'' said the 71-year-old Diller, who is appearing in the musical ``Nunsense'' at San Francisco's Marines Memorial Theater.
