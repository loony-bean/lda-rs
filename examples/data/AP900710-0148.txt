Here are some quotes from the Soviet Communist Party Congress held Tuesday in Moscow. ``I maintain only one thing: The policy that I have chosen I will pursue, and for me the biggest prize is that my homeland will live.'' _ Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``It is an illusion to think that after all dissenters, all who do not wish to be drive belts and cogs of the apparatus, quit the party, it will retain all the property of the Soviet Communist Party and the associated authority. It will not be so. ... The party will be bankrupt, obliged to repay its debts to the people, if only with its property.'' _ Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation. ``I don't see another force other than the party which could bring progress to our country.'' _ hard-liner Yegor K. Ligachev ``Our Russian thirst for blood is showing. It's stupid and ugly and inhuman.'' - Inna Dementyeva, a Moscow delegate. ``You can never go back to yesterday by any path, and no dictatorship ... solves anything. If any of the delegates came to the congress with the hope of returning the party to old conditions, comfortable or uncomfortable, this is not a question, they were seriously mistaken.'' _ Gorbachev.
