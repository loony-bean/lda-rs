Singer Lou Rawls was host of a star-studded weekend telethon that raised more than $9.4 million in pledges for the United Negro College Fund. More than 50 stars appeared in the Ninth Annual Lou Rawls Parade of Stars featuring performances from celebrities including Ray Charles, Harry Belafonte, Neil Sedaka, Ben Vereen, Aretha Franklin and Bob Hope. Taped messages from Michael Jackson and President Reagan also were shown during the seven-hour telethon. The show was broadcast locally from 6 p.m. Saturday to 1 a.m. Sunday on KTLA-TV, but will not be shown in several cities, including San Francisco, Miami, Chicago, St. Louis and Baltimore, until Dec. 30. Telethon officials said telephone lines will be open until the show has been televised in all target areas. ``The beat goes on and I'm still going,'' Rawls said during a break in taping. ``These students are going to be the next politicians, lawyers, doctors, engineers. ... We've got to make sure they get it right in order for them to fulfill themselves and their destiny,'' he said. Contributions benefit 42 member colleges. The private schools enroll about 45,000 students. Last year's telethon raised about $10 million, said college fund spokeswoman Adrienne Rhodes.
