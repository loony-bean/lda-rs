Heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson and actress Robin Givens have discussed dissolving their stormy nine-month marriage with a quick divorce in the Dominican Republic, Tyson's lawyer said. Tyson, 22, is eager to ``get on with his life,'' lawyer Howard Weitzman told the New York Post in Saturday's editions. Lawyers for Miss Givens, 23, and Tyson met Nov. 6 in Las Vegas to discuss the possibility of filing for a divorce on the Caribbean island, where divorces can be obtained in about two days, the newspaper reported. Weitzman said an offshore divorce would be quicker than the annulment request Tyson filed Oct. 14 in New Jersey, which could take a year to resolve. Tyson claimed that Miss Givens, an actress on the ABC-TV series ``Head of the Class,'' manipulated him into marriage by saying falsely that she was pregnant.
