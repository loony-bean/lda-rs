The New York Stock Exchange is requiring members to submit daily reports of their program trades, a move designed to help the exchange analyze market volatility. Under the new rule, NYSE members and member firms must submit a log of program trades made for customers or for their own accounts, including trades executed in other markets, by the close of the second business day following the trades, the exchange said in a statement Tuesday. Members are not required, however, to identify customers for whom program trades were executed.
