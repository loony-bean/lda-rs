Development of the Navy's $48.7 billion Seawolf attack submarine should be slowed until technical and financial problems are solved, says a House committee report released today. The vessel is ``perhaps the most conspicuous and potentially most costly example of a program struggling with the problems of adapting state-of-the-art computer technology into a multi-billion-dollar weapons platform,'' says the Government Operations Committee report. It recommends that Congress limit funding for construction of additional Seawolf submarines until the Pentagon clarifies the program's mission and provides assurances that the computer problems will be fixed. Spokesman Lt. Greg Smith said the Navy would have no immediate comment. Pentagon plans call for building 29 of the ships for $48.7 billion, with the first scheduled for completion in 1995 at an estimated cost of $1.9 billion. It is billed as the largest, quietest and most heavily armed nuclear attack submarines. ---
