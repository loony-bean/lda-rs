``We as an American public don't reach out to help one another like we used to. We don't share like we used to. We've become a very selfish nation.'' - Charlotte, N.C., Mayor Sue Myrick, co-chair of the United States Conference of Mayors' Task Force on Hunger and Homelessness. --- ``Considering the sorry state of education in California, it would be more appropriate to name a high school after Ronald Reagan than to name it after me.'' - Rock musician Frank Zappa, declining to have a high school named after him. --- ``Aristide is the medium through which the people have discovered the possibility of being protected by being together. That's what the other Haitian politicians didn't understand. The people wanted justice.'' - Human rights activist Jean-Claude Bajeaux on the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, probable winner in Haiti's first fully democratic election.
