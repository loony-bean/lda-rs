The dollar changed little against most major currencies in thin mid-morning trading today, and dealers forecast a steady course before the Nov. 8 presidential election in the United States. Gold prices were higher. Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar bounced back in Europe from lows hit during the Tokyo trading day on support from a third day of intervention from Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan, and fear of the same by the U.S. Federal Reserve. But they said sentiment remained essentially bearish, although the dollar was unlikely to fall sharply ahead of the U.S. election. ``The nearer we come to the election the calmer the dollar will be,'' said one trader in Milan. In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. One pound cost $1.7695 today, more expensive for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.7668.
