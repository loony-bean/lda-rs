Students at Spelman College, a black women's school, should take the fruits of their education back to their communities and help the poor, the school's new president said at her inauguration. ``If we do nothing to improve our world, then we cannot call ourselves educated women,'' Johnetta B. Cole said Sunday. ``How can we call ourselves either educated or leaders if we turn away from the very reality that a third of black America lives in poverty? ``We must build sturdy black bridges into the very communities from which we have come. For if we do not build those bridges, then we will surely drown in our own selfishness.'' Ms. Cole, first black woman president of the 107-year-old liberal arts college, was inaugurated Sunday although she has been at the school since July 1987. Her speech wrapped up a weekend that included the announcement of a $20 million gift to the school from entertainer Bill Cosby. One of Cosby's daughters attended Spelman, and episodes of his hit TV series, ``The Cosby Show,'' have been filmed there. The donation will be used mostly to construct an academic center, which will double the college's classroom space. About $8 million will go to Spelman's endowment, currently at $42 million.
