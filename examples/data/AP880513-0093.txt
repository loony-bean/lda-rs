A $76,000 appropriation for ``fuel management systems'' at two highway patrol stations raised eyebrows at a meeting of the state Building Commission. ``What's a fuel management system?'' Lt. Gov. John Wilder, commission vice chairman, asked Thursday. ``That's a gasoline pump,'' replied Safety Commissioner Robert Lawson. ``And you call it a fuel management system?'' Wilder asked. ``Yes,'' Lawson said. ``You're pumping gasoline into a vehicle?'' Wilder asked. ``Yes,'' Lawson said. ``Why don't you call it that?'' Wilder asked. ``I won't use the term again,'' Lawson promised.
