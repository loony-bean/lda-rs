Rebels ambushed a jeep east of Managua on Wednesday, killing four people and wounding one, the government said. The attack occurred at 7:45 a.m. in Comalapa near Juigalpa, the capital of Chontales province, 95 miles east of Managua, according to a statement issued by the Defense Ministry. Armando Montoya, political secretary of the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front Party in Comalapa, and Danilo Corrales, a municipal governent finance official, were killed in the attack. Two Sandinista police officers also were killed and a third was wounded, the ministry said. In another statement, the ministry said 11 rebels were killed and five wounded in clashes with troops between Aug. 30 and Sept. 6. It said the attacks took place in northern and eastern Nicaragua but did not say if government forces suffered casualties. The ministry said rebel forces killed one civilian and wounded two during that period. It provided no details. The leftist Sandinista government and the U.S.-supported rebels, known as Contras, agreed to a truce in March, but failed to negotiate an end to the 7-year-old civil war. Talks broke off June 9, and each side has accused the other of violating the truce.
