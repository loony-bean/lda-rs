Police said they raided a Mafia summit Saturday and arrested five people meeting to draw up new territories for Naples' crime families. The five were charged with criminal association of a Mafia type and with illegal possession of firearms. They are reputed leaders of the Camorra, the Neapolitan version of the Mafia. Authorities said the five met at the apartment of the boss of one Camorra gang and that the apartment had been under surveillance for months. The five were identified as Antonio Egizio, 35; his brother Umberto Egizio, 24; Vincenzo Romano, 28; Vincenzo de Michele, 36; and Salvatore Manna, 44. Police said Antonio Egizio recently sent a letter to President Francesco Cossiga complaining that he was a good person who was continously being persecuted, stopped and followed by the police.
