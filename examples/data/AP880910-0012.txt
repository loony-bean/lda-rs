A plane used in fighting forest fires crashed near an airport outside this northwestern Spanish city, killing all four of its occupants, airport officials said. Officials said one of the motors of the plane apparently failed shortly after the aircraft took off Friday from Labacolla airport. The plane crashed into a forest nearby. The victims were two captains, one lieutenant and one non-commissioned officer of the Spanish Air Force. The Labacolla-based plane had been taking part in efforts to combat a forest fire in Orense province in northwestern Spain, officials said.
