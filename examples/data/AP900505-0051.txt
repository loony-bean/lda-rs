Hooded gunmen opened fire on a crowd attending a wedding reception Saturday, killing seven people and wounding four others, the state-run news agency reported. The shooting occurred at 5 a.m. in San Carlos City in Pangasinan province, 100 miles northwest of Manila, the Philippine News Agency said. The agency quoted San Carlos police station chief Capt. Juanito Mangonon as saying the gunmen raked the wedding reception with automatic gunfire shortly after the groom and the bride left for the wedding ceremony at a Roman Catholic church, a few miles away. The assailants were apparently after one of the guests but opened fire on the people preparing the wedding reception after failing to find their target, Mangonon said. The gunmen fled on foot after the shooting.
