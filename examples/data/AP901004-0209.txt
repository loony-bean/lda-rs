Apple Computer Inc. has entered into negotiations with Toshiba Corp. to develop lower-priced computers, Toshiba officials confirmed Thursday. The announcement comes days after Japan's Sony Corp. said it is discussing forging business ties with Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, one of the leading U.S. personal computer makers. Toshiba spokesman Masao Mochizuki said Apple recently proposed the alliance, but he declined to elaborate. Analysts say Apple is seeking to diversify its product line and lower prices. ``Apple's computer is good in performance, but is rather expensive at present, so Apple is trying to develop new mass-production models to expand its market shares in Japan,'' said Yasumichi Satoh, an analyst with Sanyo Investment Management Co. Toshiba, a leading Japanese electric machinery maker, currently supplies Apple with semiconductors for its personal computers. According to Kyodo News Service, Apple is discussing an agreement under which Sony would make personal computers in Japan to be marketed under Apple's name. Sony now produces computer disk drives and displays for Apple Computer. At a board meeting held in Tokyo last week, Apple Chief Executive officver John Sculley told reporters that his company is bent on expanding its limited presence in Japan.
