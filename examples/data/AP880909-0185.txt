The death toll rose to 56 in the Aug. 28 air show disaster at a U.S. air base and a newspaper said Thursday that insurance coverage of the Italian stunt-flying team involved falls far short of estimated damage. An insurance official said, however, that organizers of such an event usually pay the largest portion of the damage. Two more West Germans died of severe burns from the accident at the U.S. Air Force Base in Ramstein and 28 people were reported in critical condition. Two Americans are among the dead. Marco Fraquelli, an official of the Milano Assicurazioni insurance company of Milan, Italy, said each of the three planes that crashed was insured for $1.4 million, for a total of $4.2 million. The Berliner Morgenpost quoted Fraquelli as saying his company expects damage claims from the crash of the three jets from the Frecce Tricolori team to reach about $120 million. ``In case of disasters like the one in Ramstein, usually the government and NATO agree on payment of damage to the victims and their relatives,'' Fraquelli told The Associated Press. Three Italian stunt-flying jets collided at low altitude at the air show and one hurtled into a crowd of spectators and exploded. Jurgen Dietzen, a spokesman for Rhineland-Palatinate State Interior Ministry said 160 people remained hospitalized. Dietzen said the last two deaths occurred between Wednesday and Thursday.
