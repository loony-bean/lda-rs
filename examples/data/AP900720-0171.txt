President Bush showed up about a half-hour late at the Cheyenne Municipal Airport on Friday evening, sporting a big smile and a baseball cap and toting a 12-inch trout. The president showed off his catch to the press and spectators as he crossed the tarmac to Air Force One, which took off around 6:40 p.m. for Washington. When asked how his fishing went, the president gave the ``thumbs up'' sign and said, ``Good.'' He then reached into a plastic garbage sack and grabbed the trout to show to the press. Bush, who'd been scheduled to arrive at the airport at 5:50 p.m. but didn't show up until around 6:20 p.m., spent about three hours fishing in the Middle Crow Creek west of Cheyenne with U.S. Sens. Al Simpson and Malcolm Wallop and Rep. Craig Thomas, all Wyoming Republicans. Simpson and Thomas said Bush's fish was the last, biggest catch of the day. They said the president appeared hesitant to leave for the airport until he caught a fish. The delegation accompanied the president to the airport, where Simpson opened a plastic garbage bag to show off the six other trout caught by the group. The president was in Cheyenne to help celebrate Wyoming's centennial, where he joined in a parade and gave a speech to thousands of spectators.
