The dollar was mixed in dull European trading today as dealers waited for new factors to get the market out of the doldrums. Gold prices fell in London following a large sell order from the Middle East, which had a big impact because the market was so thin, dealers said. Traders said last Friday's remark by Swiss National Bank President Pierre Languetin that the dollar was poised to move lower again had put a very tight lid on any upward movement of the U.S. currency. Dealers said Tuesday's congressional testimony in Washington by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to give the market new directions and they didn't expect his repeat performance for the Senate Banking Committee today to have much more impact. The release later today of fourth-quarter U.S. trade figures isn't likely to have a major impact on the market either because the figures are already known, dealers said. ``I honestly don't know what could help the dollar move,'' said one senior trader in Milan. But another dealer said Thursday's report of the first revision of U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic product growth could possibly have an effect on the dollar. In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 128.75. Later, in London, it was quoted slightly higher at 128.85 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's rates: _1.69225 West German marks, down from 1.6945 _1.3905 Swiss francs, up from 1.3895 _5.72675 French francs, up from 5.7240 _1.89775 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9000 _1,247.00 Italian lire, up from 1.246.60 _1.2673 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2712 In London, the dollar fell against the British pound.
