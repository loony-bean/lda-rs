Sony Corp. said Wednesday its profit soared five-fold in its first fiscal quarter on the strength of a ``gratifying sales performance'' and success in reducing costs. Sony said it earned 16.1 billion yen, or $122 million based on an exchange rate of 132 yen to the dollar, in the period ended June 30, up from 3.25 billion yen a year earlier. Revenue rose 37.2 percent to 463.6 billion yen, or $3.51 billion, from 337.8 billion yen a year earlier. The sales gain reflects strong demand in all areas, especially in Europe and Japan, as well as the addition of sales generated by the former CBS Records Group, which Sony bought in January. The exchange rate used to calculate dollar equivalents was the one prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
