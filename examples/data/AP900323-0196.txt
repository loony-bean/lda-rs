The U.S. dollar was slightly lower in European trading this morning as attention turned to other major currencies. Gold prices were slightly higher. ``There is no evidence of a trend in the dollar right now,'' one Milan trader said. Traders said attention continued to focus on the weakness of the Japanese yen. Anticipation was strong that monetary authorities would move to shore up the Japanese currency after the market shrugged off an increase in Japanese interest rates earlier this week. Traders said the West German mark was suffering from continuing uncertainty about the costs of German reunification. In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins, the dollar rose 0.24 yen to a closing 155.07 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 155.00 yen. In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was quoted at $1.6040, compared with $1.6015 late Thursday.
