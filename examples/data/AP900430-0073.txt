Actress Elizabeth Taylor, hospitalized three weeks with pneumonia, had a good weekend and has started poring over the thousands of cards and letters from well-wishers, her publicist said Monday. ``She's doing fine,'' spokeswoman Chen Sam said. Miss Taylor, 58, who was reported near death the previous weekend, was moved Thursday to a private room after an 10-day stay in intensive care at St. Johns Hospital and Health Center. Doctors gave no indication when Miss Taylor could leave the hospital and continue recuperating at her Beverly Hills home, Ms. Sam said. The Oscar-winning star has started to read messages from well-wishers. ``She's beginning to look at some of them, but the doctors are concerned that she get a lot of rest,'' Ms. Sam said. ``There is an unbelievable amount of interest. They (cards and letters) are coming in the masses.'' Last week, the hospital released a statement on Miss Taylor's behalf thanking fans and friends for their cards and letters during her hospitalization.
