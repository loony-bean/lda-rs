A bride who got onto her husband's Harley Davidson while still wearing her wedding gown spent the night in a hospital after it got caught in the motorcycle's back wheel. Denise Hudson and her husband, Lee, planned to ride to Raleigh, N.C., for a Grateful Dead concert after getting married July Fourth at a park. But the train of Mrs. Hudson's full-length gown got caught and dragged her under the bike. Mrs. Hudson, 28, suffered a broken pelvis and a concussion. ``She's skinned and sore. It could have been worse,'' said Hudson, 30, who received minor cuts and bruises. Paramedics had to cut the cream-colored gown to pieces to free her. Mrs. Hudson will have to spend the next few days in Grand Strand General Hospital, and the next few weeks recovering from her injuries. ``We can always have another honeymoon,'' her husband said.
