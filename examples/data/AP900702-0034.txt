Senate Republican leader Bob Dole says he does not expect President Bush to propose an increase in income tax rates, but rather to back higher oil import fees and taxes on alcohol and tobacco. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., countered Sunday on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley'' that such an approach would not raise enough money to reduce huge budget deficits. Moynihan said Democrats are prepared to force a $100 billion spending cut Oct. 1, as required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit spending law, if Bush does not increase income taxes and reduce the Social Security payroll deduction. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, meanwhile, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that the top tax rate should be raised from its present level of 28 percent to reduce the budget deficit, mentioning 33 percent and 35 percent as possibilities.
