``Deep'' (RCA-BMG) _ Peter Murphy The ``deep'' of former Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy's fourth solo project could refer to his unfathomable lyrics, but Murphy has said the title reflects both how he feels about his work _ deeply _ and his perception of the music, which he calls ``deep rock.'' It sounds more like doomsday disco. Murphy's old outfit, a post-punk British band with artistic pretensions, was among the first to mix infectious dance grooves with brooding, introspective lyrics. The style lives on in this recording and in records by The Cure, The The and others favored by masses of black-garbed club hoppers. ``Cuts You Up,'' a single from ``Deep,'' is a hit in dance clubs and on college radio, and its hook is undeniable. But it is difficult to imagine the self-absorbed Murphy finding a broader audience with songs this obtuse. _ By David Dishneau, Associated Press Writer.
