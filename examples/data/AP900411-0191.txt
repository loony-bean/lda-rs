President Bush is prodding Mikhail S. Gorbachev to show the same restraint in Lithuania as he did in Eastern Europe, praising the Soviet leader as an apostle of ``peaceful change and the evolution of democracy.'' Bush said Tuesday that Gorbachev's tolerance of democratic freedoms in Warsaw Pact nations had demonstrated ``a commitment to reform and openness that's remarkable. ``So give him credit and deal openly'' with him on problems such as Lithuania, the president said. ``But when you have difficulties like we have today, talk frankly with him about it.'' Today, Bush planned to talk about Lithuania with a group of leaders of Baltic-American groups.
