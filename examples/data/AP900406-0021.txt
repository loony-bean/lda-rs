The assailants who massacred six men and boys in a reputed crack house may have been stoned on drugs or seeking revenge for a deal gone bad, officials said. City Councilman Gilbert Hill, former head of the police department's homicide division, said he saw little difference. ``Most of the time it's not a turf battle, just thugs robbing each other,'' Hill said. ``Some of these guys walking around with Uzis and .44 Magnums, they have the brain of an ant. I don't think it's part of any organized conspiracy.'' The Wednesday night attack was the worst multiple murder in Detroit since June 1971, when seven members of a heroin ring were found shot to death in a west side apartment. No arrests had been made by Thursday night, Officer Thomas Martinelli said. The victims ranged in age from 15 to 32. According to accounts from witnesses, a woman and two men burst into the house, forced the victims to lie on the floor and started shooting them. Four of the dead were found on the second floor of the bungalow. Each had been shot in the head, Buck said. The two other victims, one of whom died shortly after arriving at a hospital, were shot trying to run downstairs and were found in the basement. Buck declined to discuss a possible motive, and calls to the department's homicide, narcotics and special crimes units weren't returned. A neighbor said the bungalow where the shootings occurred was one of a number of crack houses in the area. ``It's a drug deal gone bad,'' said Alonzo Johnson, 26. ``They are dealing drugs on every other house on every other street in this neighborhood. It's bad.''
