Hungary's reform-minded government plans to privatize the Malev state airline, the deputy transport minister said Tuesday. In an interview with the Magyar Hirlap daily, Sandor Kalnoki Kiss said the government had already received many offers for Malev but planned to hire a professional company to handle the sell-off. ``We have not agreed with anyone but we give everyone a hearing and urge them to take part in the competition,'' Kalnoki Kiss said. He said that, while it would be difficult for the government to retain a controlling stake in the airline, his ministry would seek a guarantee to have a say in future company decisions, the news agency reported. Kalnoki Kiss gave no further details. Malev's 22-plane fleet flies to 40 countries in Europe, the Middle East and North America.
