Rebels of Uganda's Holy Spirit Movement have released seven kidnapped priests and nuns after the Roman Catholic Church met their demands for medical supplies, a church official said Tuesday. The Rev. Agostoni Tarcis, secretary of the church's Justice and Peace Commission, said the abductions occurred Saturday at Amuru Mission, 19 miles from the northern provincial capital, Gulu, after an abortive rebel raid on nearby Lacor mission hospital for drugs. ``The rebels held the hostages, demanding drugs in exchange for their release,'' Tarcis said. They freed their victims, all Ugandans, the next day after the church handed over an unspecified amount of medication. In March, rebels belonging to the same group attacked Lacor hospital and got away with large quantities of drugs. Since then, government troops have guarded the medical center. The government of President Yoweri Museveni, who seized power in January 1986, is fighting several different rebel groups in northern and eastern Uganda.
