President Reagan will appoint Los Angeles federal judge Pamela Ann Rymer to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals seat vacated by Anthony M. Kennedy, it was disclosed. Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said Friday that Reagan had picked Rymer, now a U.S. District Court judge in Los Angeles, to fill the seat left in November when Kennedy was named to the U.S. Supreme Court. Wilson will nominate U.S. Attorney Robert C. Bonner of Los Angeles to replace Rymer, said Wilson aide Bill Livingstone. The formal announcement of Rymer's nomination to the appellate court is expected from the White House next week, Livingstone said. Both appointments must be confirmed by the Senate. Rymer, 46, known for her stiff sentences, is a lifelong Republican and she was on a list of candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court before Reagan settled on Kennedy last year.
