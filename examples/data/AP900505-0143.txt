A man who won $10 million in a magazine contest last year notched another victory Saturday: He was elected mayor of this city of 50,000 residents. Bob Castleberry, 60, said he had thought about running for the non-paying job for years, but couldn't afford to until he won the Publishers Clearinghouse Sweepstakes a year ago. He quit his job as a salesman for a business forms company in January to follow in the political footsteps of his father, who served on the Denton City Council. ``I grew up watching my father giving everything to the community,'' Castleberry said. ``Now I just want to do what I can.'' Castleberry beat two-term incumbent Ray Stephens, winning 50 percent of the vote to Stephens' 45 percent. Appearing in advertisements about the sweepstakes helped in the campaign by boosting his visibility in the community 35 miles northwest of Dallas, the new mayor said. Castleberry gets his $10 million in annal installments: He got $500,000 last year and gets $250,000 a year for the next 27 years, when a lump sum of $2 million is due. Castleberry used part of the money to set up scholarships at Texas A&M; University, the University of North Texas and Texas Woman's University and to buy a $32,000 car. It wasn't immediately known how much he spent on the campaign.
