Student radicals and dissidents today attacked a government party office and staged anti-government demonstrations demanding the arrest of the disgraced former president, Chun Doo-hwan. News reports said about a dozen students briefly occupied an office of President Roh Tae-woo's governing Democratic Justice Party in the southern city of Chonju. ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan,'' they shouted while attacking the office and destroying windows with rocks and steel pipes, according to the reports. Police, firing tear gas, retook the building in 20 minutes and arrested six students, the reports said. The other students ran away, they said. In southern Seoul, 1,200 radical students and dissidents held an outdoor rally denouncing Roh for blocking public efforts to divulge more details of misdeeds committed during Chun's administration. They dispersed voluntarily after a two-mile march down a main street. About 4,000 riot police were posted, but no clashes were reported. In the southern city of Kwangju, 300 people, mostly students, marched peacefully through downtown streets, shouting slogans demanding Chun's arrest, the South Korean news agency Yonhap said. They dispersed in two hours, it said. Chun, who left office in February, went into self-imposed rural exile last month after apologizing to the nation for corruption and other scandals involving his seven-year authoritarian rule. Chun denied personal wrongdoing, but some of his family members have been arrested for taking bribes or embezzeling official funds.
