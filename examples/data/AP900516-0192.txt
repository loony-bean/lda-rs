Word of Sammy Davis Jr.'s death from throat cancer drew friends and associates to his gated hilltop home Wednesday. Actress Loretta Swit and others who identified themselves as Hollywood producers and executives passed through a crowd of reporters and television crews to pay a visit to Davis' widow, Altovise. ``You never met anybody who lived life so fully as he,'' said actor Roscoe Browne. ``He took the whole thing and went for it.'' Early in the day, Davis' business manager, Shirley Rhodes, came outside the gate to confirm to reporters that Davis had died. By her side was one of Davis' sons, Mark. Asked how the family was doing, Mark Davis said, ``Pretty good.'' ``We're just trying to get it all together, trying to get our thoughts and nerves together,'' said Ms. Rhodes. She said Davis' three sons and wife were at his side when he died in his sleep at 5:59 a.m. The death of the entertainment superstar created a commotion on the quiet, twisting street lined with gated mansions. Television news vans and reporters' cars parked under ``No Parking'' signs along the two-lane street. Reporters milled under a ``No Trespassing'' sign in front of Davis' home. Two Star Line Tour vans drove slowly past the home as tourists snapped pictures through the windows. Gardeners and city workers slowed down to ask reporters what was going on and residents drove by in the Mercedes-Benzes, Porsches and Rolls-Royces, shaking their heads in disgust at the crush. A half-dozen curiosity-seekers arrived at the home. Florist trucks arrived throughout the day with deliveries.
