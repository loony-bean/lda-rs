A United Airlines workers group announced Friday they were ending an agreement with an investment partnership to acquire the carrier's parent, UAL Corp. But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the worker group, United Employment Acquisition Corp., said it was still interested in acquiring the Chicago-based airline. ``In light of current market conditions and in order to maximize the flexibility of UEAC to pursue any appropriate transaction for the acquisition of UAL, UEAC and Condor Partners L.P. entered into the termination agreement dated as of Sept. 13, 1990,'' the filing stated. The disclosure, which came after the markets closed Friday, ended an agreement between UEAC and Condor, an affiliate of Coniston Partners, to help UEAC, a company formed by United's unions, acquire UAL. Coniston Partners is the largest shareholder of UAL. Last October, news of the collapse of an employee-management leveraged buyout of UAL prompted a 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. Officials at United Airlines refused to comment on Friday's announcement by the employee group. A representative at Coniston Partners called the move a ``non-event'' and a ``tactical move.'' They refused to comment further.
