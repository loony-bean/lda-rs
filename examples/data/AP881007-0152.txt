Leftist rebels claimed responsibility Friday for a rocket-propelled grenade attack on the national legislature, which they called ``the lair of the corrupt.'' Radio Venceremos, the guerrillas' clandestine station, said the Thursday attack, which damaged a wall but caused no injuries, was an operation dubbed ``Armed with bazookas, the people will triumph.'' A projectile fired from a Chinese-made RPG-2 slammed into a wall of the unicameral National Assembly shortly before the day's session began. The impact startled spectators entering the building only a few yards from where the grenade struck. ``This audacious guerrilla action demonstrates the inability of the puppet armed forces, a useless army that is not even capable of guarding utility poles, nor highways, nor its own barracks, nor the National Assembly,'' said the Radio Venceremos broadcast. The broadcast characterized the Assembly as ``the lair of the corrupt and death-squad members.'' A congressional commission and several judges are investigating cases of alleged misuse of public funds by government officials. There have also been allegations right-wing death squads operated out of the Assembly building during the early 1980s, when thousands of suspected leftists were abducted and murdered. A 9-year-old civil war pits the rebels against forces of the U.S.-backed Christian Democratic administration. In 1982, the Assembly was the target of a similar rocket-propelled grenade attack, which also caused no injuries. About 65,000 people have been killed in the war, the majority of them civilians.
