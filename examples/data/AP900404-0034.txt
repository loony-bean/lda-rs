A suburb is having a devil of a time with its new voting precinct number. Deer Park Council members approved a resolution Tuesday asking the commissioners of Harris County to renumber Precinct 666 because some religious folk view the number as symbolic of the Antichrist. ``Deer Park is a fairly conservative, religious community, and it's just a stigma they don't want,'' said Harvey Petree, a Deer Park city councilman. ``I had never heard that the three sixes had any religious connotation,'' said County Commissioner Jim Fonteno. ``If I would have known then what I know now, I would have just asked the clerk to skip a number.'' Election officials redrew Precinct 470 in August because it had grown to include 3,200 residents, Fonteno said. The county splits any precinct with more than 3,000 residents each August, with the new numbers taking effect in March. When the Deer Park districts were split, the new jurisdiction got the next available number, 666.
