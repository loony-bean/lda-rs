Right-wing extremists spray-painted swastikas and pro-Nazi slogans on a synagogue in a Bavarian village on the eve of ceremonies marking the Kristallnacht anniversary, police said today. The swastikas and words ``Heil Hitler'' were sprayed Tuesday on the synagogue's outside wall in large letters with black paint, police in Binswangen said. Binswangen is a small village in southern West Germany. Police said they removed the swastikas and Nazi slogan in time for a 50th anniversary Kristallnacht ceremony in the synagogue today. The Binswangen synagogue was one of hundreds of Jewish houses of worship attacked by Nazis on Nov. 9, 1938. The Moorish-style synagogue was reconstructed after the war. Police said they had not identified any suspects.
