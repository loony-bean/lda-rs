The Federal Communications Commission has decided to relax its rule on ownership of more than one radio station. The new rule would allow commonly owned stations to be as close as 25 miles apart, as long as they are in different markets. The rule would reduce by about half the distance required between two stations owned by the same person or company, and it would allow common ownership of stations in adjacent markets. The FCC said the new rule will enable more station owners to take greater advantage of the economies of scale and cost savings that result from common ownership of stations. The FCC also agreed to recommend that Congress require cable companies to negotiate with out-of-town TV stations for the rights to carry their signals. The commission is expected to extend that recommendation to cover local TV signals before it issues a final order in the matter.
